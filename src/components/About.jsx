                <div className="container-sm">
                    <p>My then 8 year old granddaughter, E named the agency/brokerage – five years ago we were walking outside hand in hand on a beautiful spring morning and talking about opening an agency. E thought it would be a great idea and looked up and said “Call it Tree Top Insurance.” I asked her how she came up with that name and she replied “Easy Nana, we love trees and you are the best top insurance agent!” So now we had the name but needed a logo - she drew a willow tree! So the name and tree became digitized and the logo was born!</p>
